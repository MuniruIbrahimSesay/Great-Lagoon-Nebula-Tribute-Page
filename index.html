          <ul>
            <li>To celebrate its 28th anniversary in space the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope took this amazing and colourful image of the LagoonNebula.</li>
            <li>The whole nebula, about 4000 light-years away, is an incredible 55 light-years wide and 20 light-years tall.</li>
            <li>This image shows only a small part of this turbulent star-formation region, about four light-years across.</li>
            <li>This stunning nebula was first catalogued in 1654 by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Hodierna, who sought to recordnebulous objects in the night sky so they would not be mistaken for comets.</li>
            <li>Since Hodierna’s observations, the Lagoon Nebula has been photographed and analysed by many telescopes and astronomers all over theworld.</li>
            <li>The observations were taken by Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 between 12 February and 18 February 2018.</li>
            <li>The Lagoon Nebula (catalogued as Messier 8 or M8, NGC 6523, Sharpless 25, RCW 146, and Gum 72) is a giant interstellar cloud in theconstellation Sagittarius. It is classified as an emission nebula and as an H II region.</li>
            <li>The Lagoon Nebula is estimated to be between 4,000-6,000 light-years away from the Earth. In the sky of Earth, it spans 90' by 40',which translates to an actual dimension of 110 by 50 light years.</li>
            <li>Like many nebulas, it appears pink in time-exposure color photos but is gray to the eye peering through binoculars or a telescope,human vision having poor color sensitivity at low light levels.</li>
            <li>The nebula contains a number of Bok globules (dark, collapsing clouds of protostellar material), the most prominent of which havebeen catalogued by E. E. Barnard as B88, B89 and B296.</li>
            <li>It also includes a funnel-like or tornado-like structure caused by a hot O-type star that emanates ultraviolet light, heating andionizing gases on the surface of the nebula.</li>
            <li>The Lagoon Nebula also contains at its centre a structure known as the Hourglass Nebula (so named by John Herschel), which shouldnot be confused with the better known Engraved Hourglass Nebula in the constellation of Musca.</li>
            <li>In 2006 the first four Herbig–Haro objects were detected within the Hourglass, also including HH 870. This provides the firstdirect evidence of active star formation by accretion within it.</li>
          </ul>
